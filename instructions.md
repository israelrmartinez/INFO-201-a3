# a3:using-data
### Preparation
1. Please read: (1) Freeman and Ross(2019), Chapters 9-10; and (2) Oâ€™Neil (2016), Chapter #2, Shell Shocked (pp. 32-49).

## Learning suggestions
1. Not to nag, please read the Book. Truly: The answers are there.
1. You'll follow the same pattern with GitHub and Git for cloning the repository and pushing your work - if you are having trouble with Git please ask TA/Instructor for help
1. In this assignment you will work with data. Hence, be a scientist! Scrutinize and investigate the data. Seek to understand the structure of the data in great detail. Your effort will be time well-spent.  Some suggested questions:
  * What do the observations mean? What do they represent or refer to?
  * What variables make up an observation?
  * For each variable, what are their levels of measurement? For ratio and interval levels, what is the maximum and minimum value? For ordinal data, what are the labels and how are they ordered?  
  * How do the variables relate to each other? Do any of the variables depend on each other? If so, how precisely?

### Notes
1. Unless otherwise stated, this assignment should be completed _individually_.
2. Once you have finished the two parts of this assignment be sure to push your repository back to GitHub and then submit your GitHub repo link to Canvas.

**Pro-tip:** Once you have created your repository on GitHub submit its URL link to Canvas.  That way you will not forget to submit to Canvas by deadline.

## Part I: Coding: Tasks
Open the file `assignment.r` in RStudio. Complete each of the programming tasks by typing correct R code after each task. Please see the [rubric](rubric.md) for detailed guidance on how the coding tasks will be graded.

## Part II: Critical thinking: Writing responses
Open the file ``writing_responses.md`` and complete the writing responses.
